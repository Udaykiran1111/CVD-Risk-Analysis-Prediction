# Patient Health Risk Insights Dashboard

This project analyzes the **Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)** dataset from Mendeley Data to extract meaningful insights about patient health and predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.  
It combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Logistic Regression-based classification**, and an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to present actionable insights.

 # Project Objectives

- Perform thorough data cleaning and exploratory analysis  
- Identify important risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disease  
- Build a classification model using Logistic Regression  
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics  
- Design an interactive, user-friendly Power BI dashboard for visualization
